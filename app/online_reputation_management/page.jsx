                Why monitoring continuously is crucial
              </h1>

              <p className="text-[14px]">
                ORM requires monitoring and ongoing management of the content
                published and disseminated about you on the web to control your
                communication and brand image fully. An agency specializing in
                ORM services thus brings together several trades, all sensitive,
                requiring very specific know-how, particularly in terms of
                reference, and adapted tools to achieve tangible results. To
                increase traffic, you can think of a marketing strategy that
                implements SEO positioning and targeted SEM campaigns. We
                monitor and analyze the progress of the marketing campaigns in
                progress and the performance of the online site in time. Through
                web analytics and orm services, it will be able to manage any
                critical points or moments and respond promptly to changes and
                market opportunities.
